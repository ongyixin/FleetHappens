## Test Setup

We ran 4 identical fleet analytics questions against all three channels on a demo database with 50 active vehicles.

## Timing Results

| Question | OData | API | Ace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1: Total fleet distance (14 days) | 4.87s | 1.29s | ~41s |
| Q2: Top 5 vehicles by distance | 0s* | 0.01s* | ~46s |
| Q3: Fleet idle time percentage | 0s* | 0.02s* | ~35s |
| Q4: Vehicle count & health | 10.94s | 0.58s | ~30s |

\* Q2 and Q3 reused data already fetched in Q1 (client-side aggregation), so the real cost is the initial fetch.

## Q1: Total Fleet Distance in Last 14 Days

**Question:** *What is the total distance driven by the entire fleet in the last 14 days?*

| Metric | OData | API | Ace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total distance | 490,906 km | 415,543 km | 304,833 km |
| Vehicles | 50 | 50 | 50 |
| Trips | 29,526 | 25,000 (capped) | 29,526 |

### Why the numbers differ

- **OData** queries the pre-aggregated `VehicleKpi_Daily` table. It returned 700 records (50 vehicles x 14 days) — complete data, no caps.
- **API** returns raw `Trip` objects. The result was capped at 25,000 records (the API's default limit), so the total is an undercount.
- **Ace** generated SQL against `VehicleKPI_Daily` but applied an `IsTracked = TRUE` filter it inferred on its own, which excluded some historical device assignments and lowered the total.

**Takeaway:** OData gives the most complete pre-aggregated picture. The API is fast but can hit result caps on large fleets — you need pagination. Ace writes good SQL but may apply filters you didn't ask for.

---

## Q2: Top 5 Vehicles by Distance

All three channels agreed on the same top 5 vehicles (same DeviceIds). The absolute distances differed for the same reasons as Q1 — OData highest (complete daily aggregates), API slightly lower (25K trip cap), Ace lowest (implicit `IsTracked` filter).

Ace helpfully included `DeviceName` by auto-joining the metadata table — something you'd need to do manually with OData or the API.

---

## Q3: Fleet Idle Time Percentage

| Metric | OData | API | Ace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drive hours | 8,520 hrs | 7,214 hrs | 8,486 hrs |
| Idle hours | 104 hrs | 88 hrs | 103 hrs |
| Idle % | **1.2%** | **1.2%** | **1.2%** |

All three agree on 1.2% idle. The ratio is consistent even though absolute hours differ due to result caps (API) and filtering (Ace). OData and Ace query the same underlying `VehicleKPI_Daily` data, so their absolute hours are nearly identical.

---

## Q4: Vehicle Count & Device Health

| Metric | OData | API | Ace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total vehicles | 150 | 50 | 50 |
| Communicated (24h) | 50 | 50 | 50 |

### Why vehicle counts differ

- **OData** (`LatestVehicleMetadata`) returned 150 records because it includes historical device assignments — vehicles with expired date ranges that are no longer active.
- **API** (`Device` entity) returned 50 active devices. This is the most accurate count for currently active vehicles.
- **Ace** filtered on active, tracked vehicles, matching the API's count.

**Takeaway:** For active vehicle counts, use the API's `Device` entity. OData's metadata table includes historical records.

## Detailed Channel Comparison

### OData Data Connector

**How it works:** HTTP GET requests with Basic Auth to an OData v4 endpoint. Returns pre-aggregated daily/hourly/monthly tables.

**Strengths:**
- Clean, BI-ready tables — no aggregation code needed
- Consistent schema across all databases
- Date range filters built in (`$search=last_14_day`)
- Ideal for Power BI, Tableau, Excel with scheduled refresh
- Complete data (no result caps on KPI tables)

**Weaknesses:**
- No server-side filtering beyond date ranges (can't filter by vehicle or group in the query)
- Returns all vehicles — client must filter/aggregate
- New accounts have a 2–3 hour backfill delay
- Not accessible from MyGeotab Add-Ins (requires password-based auth on a separate server)
- Medium speed (~5–11s per query)

**Best for:** Recurring dashboards, BI tool connections, fleet-wide reports

### MyGeotab API

**How it works:** REST/JSON-RPC calls to `my.geotab.com/apiv1`. Returns raw entity objects (Trip, Device, LogRecord, etc.).

**Strengths:**
- Fastest channel (~0.5–2s per query)
- Most flexible — full access to all 34+ entity types
- Rich filtering via search objects (by device, date, group, driver)
- Real-time data (DeviceStatusInfo for live positions)
- Works inside MyGeotab Add-Ins via the `api` object

**Weaknesses:**
- **Fleet-wide aggregation doesn't scale.** The API itself is fast for targeted queries (trips for one vehicle, current location of a device). But the pattern of "fetch all trips across the entire fleet, then aggregate in pandas" breaks down on production fleets — you'll hit result caps, need extensive pagination, and spend significant time on client-side computation. See [Demo vs Production](#demo-vs-production) below.
- Results capped at 5,000 per call (need pagination for large datasets)
- Requires code to aggregate (sum trips, calculate idle percentages, etc.)
- Duration fields may need parsing

**Best for:** Custom applications, real-time monitoring, Add-Ins, granular per-vehicle/per-trip analysis

---

### Geotab Ace

**How it works:** Natural language questions sent to the Ace API. Returns auto-generated SQL, reasoning, and results.

**Strengths:**
- No code required — ask questions in plain English
- Returns the SQL it generated (learn the data model by reading it)
- Automatically joins tables, converts units, adds device names
- Great for exploration and ad-hoc questions
- Works in Add-Ins via the [Ace API](../skills/geotab/references/ACE_API.md)

**Weaknesses:**
- Slowest channel (~30–45s per question)
- May apply implicit filters you didn't ask for (e.g., `IsTracked = TRUE`)
- Can auto-convert units (km to miles) without being asked
- Results can vary between runs for the same question
- Rate limited

**Best for:** Ad-hoc exploration, fleet manager self-service, learning the data model, quick answers without coding

## When to Use What

| Your situation | Use this |
|---|---|
| Building a Power BI / Tableau dashboard | OData |
| Building a Python reporting script | OData (if KPI-level data suffices) or API (if you need trip-level detail) |
| Building a MyGeotab Add-In | API (or Ace for natural language features) |
| Need real-time vehicle positions | API (`DeviceStatusInfo`) |
| Fleet manager wants quick answers | Ace |
| Need to validate data across sources | Cross-reference API `Device` count with OData KPIs |
| Analyzing specific trips or routes | API (OData doesn't have trip-level data) |
| Monthly executive reports | OData (`VehicleKpi_Monthly`) |
| Learning what data Geotab has | Ace (ask it questions, read the SQL it generates) |

---

## Data Accuracy Notes

Even identical questions can return different numbers across channels:

1. **Result caps:** The API has a default result limit. Always paginate for complete data.
2. **Historical records:** OData metadata tables include inactive/historical device assignments. The API's `Device` entity returns only active devices.
3. **Implicit filters:** Ace may add filters like `IsTracked = TRUE` based on its interpretation of your question.
4. **Aggregation level:** OData gives you pre-aggregated daily/monthly totals. The API gives you raw per-trip data that you sum yourself. Small rounding differences are normal.
5. **Unit conversion:** Ace may auto-convert km to miles. OData and API always return metric units.

When numbers don't match, it's usually one of these reasons — not a bug.

## Demo vs Production

> **The benchmarks above were run on a demo database with 50 vehicles.** Production fleets can have hundreds or thousands of vehicles, and the API's aggregation pattern changes dramatically at scale.

The API itself scales well for targeted queries — fetching trips for a specific vehicle, getting a device's current location, reading fault codes for one asset. What *doesn't* scale is using it as a fleet-wide aggregation engine: "fetch all trips for all vehicles, then sum/group/rank in pandas." That pattern works smoothly on a demo but becomes impractical in production:

| | Demo (50 vehicles) | Production (500–5,000+ vehicles) |
|---|---|---|
| Trips per month | ~30K | 300K–3M+ |
| API calls needed | 1–6 (with pagination) | Dozens to hundreds |
| Client-side aggregation | Instant | Minutes, memory-intensive |
| Result cap issues | Rarely hit | Constantly hit |

**The practical takeaway:** If you're building something that works on a demo database using raw API calls and client-side aggregation, think about whether it will still work at production scale. For fleet-wide KPIs (distance, fuel, idle time, safety), the **OData Data Connector** was designed exactly for this — it gives you pre-aggregated daily/monthly tables that scale to any fleet size with the same query speed.

Use the **API** when you need per-trip, per-event, or real-time data for specific vehicles. Use **OData** when you need fleet-wide aggregates. This distinction barely matters on a demo database — but it's the difference between a working app and an unusable one in production.
