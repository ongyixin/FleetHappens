# Using the Geotab Add-In Architect Gem

**Build custom MyGeotab pages in minutes using Google Gemini.**

This guide shows you how to use the **Geotab Add-In Architect** Gem to generate MyGeotab Add-Ins without writing code.

---

## What This Gem Does

The Geotab Add-In Architect generates **ready-to-paste JSON configurations** that add custom pages to your MyGeotab interface. No coding, no hosting, no technical setup required.

**You describe what you want → The Gem creates the configuration → You paste it into MyGeotab → Done.**

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Open the Gem

Go to [Geotab Add-In Architect Gem](#) *(link to public Gem when available)*

Or search for "Geotab Add-In Architect" in Google Gemini's Gem store.

### Step 2: Describe What You Want

Tell the Gem what your Add-In should do. Be specific:

**Good prompt:**
```
Create an Add-In that shows:
- Total number of vehicles in my fleet
- Total number of drivers
- My username and database name
Use a clean card-based layout with blue accents.
```

**Bad prompt:**
```
Make me an add-in
```

### Step 3: Copy the JSON

The Gem will output a JSON configuration block. Select and copy the entire JSON (from the opening `{` to the closing `}`).

### Step 4: Install in MyGeotab

1. Log into **MyGeotab**
2. Go to: **Administration → System → System Settings → Add-Ins**
3. Click **"New Add-In"**
4. Click the **"Configuration"** tab
5. **Paste** the JSON you copied
6. Click **"Save"**
7. **Hard refresh** the page: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
8. Look for your new menu item in the **left sidebar**

## Example Prompts

### Fleet Overview Dashboard

```
Build an Add-In dashboard that shows:
- Total vehicles
- Total drivers
- Current user and database
- A refresh button to reload the data

Use a modern card layout with shadows and a gradient header.
```

### Vehicle List

```
Create an Add-In that displays a table of all my vehicles showing:
- Vehicle name
- Serial number
- Vehicle type

Make it sortable by clicking column headers.
```

### Trip Summary

```
Build an Add-In showing trips from the last 24 hours:
- Vehicle name
- Trip start time
- Trip distance
- Trip duration

Include a total count at the top.
```

### Driver Scorecard

```
Create an Add-In that shows my drivers with their:
- Name
- Email
- Group membership

Display it as a clean list with alternating row colors.
```

### Quick Stats Widget

```
Make a simple Add-In that displays three big numbers:
- Active vehicles today
- Total trips today
- Total distance driven today

Use large fonts and colorful cards.
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific About Data

Tell the Gem exactly what data you want to see:

| Instead of... | Say... |
|--------------|--------|
| "Show vehicles" | "Show vehicle name, serial number, and group" |
| "Display trips" | "Show trips from the last 7 days with distance and duration" |
| "Driver info" | "Show driver name, email, and license number" |

### Describe the Layout

The Gem can create various layouts:

- **"Use cards with shadows"** - Modern card-based design
- **"Display as a table"** - Traditional data table
- **"Use a gradient header"** - Colorful header section
- **"Make it minimalist"** - Simple, clean design
- **"Add a refresh button"** - Interactive elements

### Request Specific Colors

```
Use these colors:
- Header: dark blue (#1a365d)
- Cards: white with light gray border
- Accent color: green (#38a169)
```

### Ask for Loading States

```
Show "Loading..." while fetching data, then display the results.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Add-In doesn't appear in the menu

1. **Hard refresh** the page: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. Check that you **saved** the configuration
3. Look under the correct menu section (usually "Activity")

### "Issue Loading This Page" error

The JSON may have a syntax error. Ask the Gem:
```
The Add-In shows an error. Can you check the JSON for syntax issues and regenerate it?
```

### Data not showing

1. Open browser **Developer Tools** (F12) → Console tab
2. Look for red error messages
3. Share the error with the Gem:
```
I'm getting this error in the console: [paste error message]
Can you fix it?
```

### Styles not applying

Embedded Add-Ins must use inline styles. Ask the Gem:
```
The styling isn't working. Can you make sure all CSS is inline using style="" attributes?
```

## Limitations

**The Gem creates embedded Add-Ins which have some constraints:**

| Can Do | Cannot Do |
|--------|-----------|
| Display any Geotab data | Connect to external APIs |
| Create interactive buttons | Use complex frameworks |
| Build responsive layouts | Include images (without URLs) |
| Style with inline CSS | Use external CSS files |
| Multiple API calls | Real-time streaming updates |

**For advanced Add-Ins** (external APIs, complex interactivity, React frameworks), you'll need external hosting. See the [Building Geotab Add-Ins guide](GEOTAB_ADDINS.md) for hosted options.

## Quick Reference: Common Data Types

When describing what data you want, use these terms:

| You Want | Tell the Gem |
|----------|-------------|
| Vehicles/trucks | "Device data" or "vehicles" |
| Drivers | "Drivers" or "users who are drivers" |
| GPS locations | "LogRecord data" or "GPS points" |
| Geofences | "Zone data" or "geofences" |
| Speeding events | "ExceptionEvent data for speeding" |
| Trip history | "Trip data" |
| Fuel fill-ups | "FuelTransaction data" |
| Vehicle groups | "Group data" |
| Rules | "Rule data" |

## Example: Complete Workflow

### 1. You ask:
```
Create a simple fleet dashboard showing:
- How many vehicles I have
- How many drivers
- My username
Make it look professional with a dark header and white cards.
```

### 2. The Gem responds with JSON:
```json
{
  "name": "Fleet Dashboard",
  "supportEmail": "user@example.com",
  "version": "1.0",
  "items": [{
    "url": "dashboard.html",
    "path": "ActivityLink",
    "menuName": {
      "en": "Fleet Dashboard"
    }
  }],
  "files": {
    "dashboard.html": "<!DOCTYPE html>..."
  }
}
```

### 3. You paste into MyGeotab:
Administration → System Settings → Add-Ins → New Add-In → Configuration → Paste → Save

### 4. You see your new page:
Find "Fleet Dashboard" in the left sidebar and click it.

**That's it. Describe what you want, copy the JSON, paste into MyGeotab, and your custom page is live.**
