# The Geotab Ecosystem: A Primer for Partners

**What if your hackathon project could reach 5 million vehicles?**

The Geotab Marketplace is where fleet solutions become real products. Over 350 companies have built profitable businesses here—from dashcam startups to enterprise maintenance platforms. Your prototype today could be in the Marketplace tomorrow.

This primer shows you what's possible.

## What Can You Build?

The Marketplace has 15 categories. Each represents a real customer problem and a business opportunity:

| Category | The Problem | What Partners Build |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Cameras & ADAS** | Fleets need video evidence and driver safety | AI dashcams, collision alerts, driver monitoring |
| **Maintenance & Diagnostics** | Breakdowns cost $500-$700/day | Predictive maintenance, fault alerts, shop scheduling |
| **Asset & Trailer Tracking** | 30% of trailers sit unused or lost | BLE trackers, GPS tags, utilization dashboards |
| **Risk Management** | Insurance costs keep rising | Driver scoring, coaching programs, behavior analytics |
| **Routing & Dispatch** | Inefficient routes waste fuel and time | Route optimization, real-time dispatch, ETA predictions |
| **Fuel Management** | Fuel is 20-30% of fleet costs | Fuel card integration, theft detection, consumption analytics |
| **Compliance** | Regulations require proof | ELD, HOS tracking, DVIR, IFTA reporting |
| **Sustainability** | Fleets must report carbon emissions | EV readiness, carbon tracking, green fleet analytics |
| **Mobile Workflow** | Drivers need digital tools | Proof of delivery, digital forms, field service apps |
| **Connected Sensors** | Cargo needs monitoring | Temperature, tire pressure, door status, fuel level |
| **Insurance** | Fleets want lower premiums | Usage-based insurance, risk scoring, claims automation |
| **Fleet Management** | Operations are complex | Dispatching, utilization, multi-site management |
| **Integration & Consulting** | Custom needs exist | API integrations, custom development, implementation |
| **TMS & Logistics** | Freight needs coordination | Load planning, shipment tracking, carrier management |

## From Hackathon to Marketplace: Real Examples

### Cameras That Pay for Themselves

**Lytx Surfsight** — AI-powered dashcam integrated into MyGeotab.

A customer deployed Geotab GO devices with Surfsight cameras. Result: **30% reduction in insurance premiums ($45,000/year saved)**. The cameras paid for themselves.

**What you could build:** An AI that detects distracted driving, tailgating, or near-misses from dashcam footage.

---

### Maintenance That Prevents Breakdowns

**Fleetio** — Syncs with Geotab for automated odometer updates and fault code alerts. When Geotab detects a check engine light, Fleetio automatically creates a work order.

Connects to **85,000+ maintenance shops** across the US.

**What you could build:** A predictive model that says "this vehicle will break down in 2 weeks" based on engine data patterns.

---

### Asset Tracking Beyond Vehicles

**Link Labs** — BLE and GPS trackers for trailers, containers, and equipment. Custom Add-In shows all tracked assets in MyGeotab.

**What you could build:** A "where's my stuff?" dashboard that shows every trailer, tool, and container across the fleet.

---

### Safety That Transforms Culture

**White Cap + Holman** — Construction company with 600+ vehicles.

Results with Geotab + cameras + coaching:
- **97% reduction** in speeding violations
- **97% reduction** in seatbelt violations
- **62% reduction** in aggressive driving

**What you could build:** A gamified safety leaderboard that rewards good driving with real incentives.

---

### Analytics That Find Money

**City of Miami Gardens** — Used Geotab data to optimize their fleet.

Results:
- **$60,000+ annually** in operational savings
- **$1.1 million** from vehicle resales (right-sizing the fleet)

**What you could build:** A "fleet advisor" that spots underused vehicles, recommends replacements, and calculates ROI.

---

### EV Transition Planning

**Enterprise Fleet Management** — Geotab analyzed **91,252 vehicles** for EV readiness.

Findings:
- **13%** could switch to EVs today (saving $33 million)
- **45%** could switch once electric pickups arrive (saving $167 million)
- **1.3 million tons** of CO2 reduction

**What you could build:** An EV suitability calculator that shows which vehicles should go electric first.
