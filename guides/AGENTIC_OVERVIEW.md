# Agentic Fleet Systems: Overview

**Autonomous agents that monitor your fleet and take action—without you lifting a finger.**

This guide explains what "agentic" means for fleet management, when you need it, and which tools to use.

---

## What is an "Agentic" System?

Traditional fleet tools require you to check dashboards, run reports, and take action manually. An **agentic system** flips this:

| Traditional Approach | Agentic Approach |
|---------------------|------------------|
| You check the dashboard | The system monitors continuously |
| You notice a problem | The system detects it automatically |
| You decide what to do | The system decides (rules or AI) |
| You take action | The system acts (alerts, tickets, API calls) |

### The Agentic Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   MONITOR → DETECT → DECIDE → ACT → (repeat forever)   │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Monitor**: Continuously watch Geotab data (vehicle locations, speeds, fault codes, trips)
2. **Detect**: Identify conditions that matter (speeding, geofence entry, engine fault, idle time)
3. **Decide**: Apply rules or AI reasoning to determine response
4. **Act**: Send alerts, create tickets, update systems, notify people

---

## Geotab Already Has Alerts—When Do You Need More?

**Important:** Geotab's built-in features handle many common scenarios:

| Built-In Feature | What It Does |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Rules & Exceptions** | Trigger on speeding, harsh braking, after-hours use, etc. |
| **Zones (Geofences)** | Detect entry/exit from defined areas |
| **Notifications** | Send email alerts when rules trigger |
| **Reports** | Scheduled email reports |

**Use Geotab native features when:**
- Email alerts are sufficient
- You need standard rule-based triggers (speed > X, zone entry, fault codes)
- You're okay with Geotab's built-in notification destinations

---

## When External Agentic Systems Add Value

Build an external agent when you need capabilities **beyond** Geotab's native features:

### 1. Different Alert Destinations
Geotab sends email. You need **Slack, Teams, Discord, SMS, PagerDuty**, or push notifications.

### 2. Integration with External Systems
- Create tickets in **ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk**
- Update records in **Salesforce, HubSpot, SAP**
- Log to **Google Sheets, Airtable, databases**
- Trigger webhooks in **custom applications**

### 3. Multi-Step Workflows
Not just "alert when X happens" but:
```
Fault code detected →
  Check vehicle location →
  Find nearest service center →
  Create maintenance ticket →
  Alert driver with directions →
  Notify fleet manager →
  Update CRM status
```

### 4. AI-Powered Decisions
Beyond threshold rules—using LLMs to:
- Analyze patterns and trends
- Generate personalized coaching recommendations
- Summarize incidents in natural language
- Make context-aware decisions

### 5. Cross-System Correlation
Combine Geotab data with external data:
- Weather conditions + driving behavior
- Traffic data + route optimization
- Customer delivery windows + ETA calculations

### 6. Custom Business Logic
Rules that don't fit Geotab's rule builder:
- "Alert only if this is the driver's 3rd speeding event this week"
- "Notify customer when delivery is 15 minutes away, but only during business hours"
- "Escalate to manager if no response within 30 minutes"

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Polling Loop (Simplest)

```
┌──────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Timer   │────▶│ Fetch Data │────▶│ Check    │
│ (5 min)  │     │ from Geotab│     │ Condition│
└──────────┘     └────────────┘     └────┬─────┘
                                         │
                              ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                              │ Condition met?      │
                              │ Yes → Send Alert    │
                              │ No  → Wait for next │
                              └─────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:** Simple, no infrastructure needed
**Cons:** Delay between event and detection (up to polling interval)

### Pattern 2: Webhook/Event-Driven

```
┌──────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ Geotab   │────▶│ Webhook    │────▶│ Process  │
│ Event    │     │ Endpoint   │     │ & Act    │
└──────────┘     └────────────┘     └──────────┘
```

**Pros:** Near real-time, efficient
**Cons:** Requires webhook support, always-on endpoint

### Pattern 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Monitor    │────▶│ Analyzer    │────▶│ Actor       │
│ Agent      │     │ Agent (AI)  │     │ Agent       │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
      │                   │                   │
      └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                    Coordinator
```

**Pros:** Complex reasoning, scalable
**Cons:** More infrastructure, higher cost

## Data Flow Directions

Most examples focus on **Geotab → External** (monitoring fleet, alerting elsewhere). But agents can work in multiple directions:

### Direction 1: Geotab → External (Outbound)
**Monitor fleet data, act on external systems.**

```
Geotab speeding event → Slack alert
Geotab fault code → ServiceNow ticket
Geotab trip completion → Customer notification
```

This is the most common pattern—and what the [n8n Quickstart](./AGENTIC_QUICKSTART_N8N.md) teaches.

---

### Direction 2: External → Geotab (Inbound)
**Monitor external sources, act on your fleet.**

```
Weather forecast → Create hazard zones in Geotab
Traffic news → Update routes for drivers
Customer order → Assign vehicle to delivery
Price change → Update fuel stop recommendations
```

**This is powerful but underutilized.** Your agents can proactively prepare your fleet for external events.

---

### Direction 3: Bidirectional
**Full integration loop between systems.**

```
Customer places order in Shopify
  → Agent assigns nearest vehicle in Geotab
  → Geotab tracks delivery progress
  → Agent updates customer with ETA
  → Delivery completes in Geotab
  → Agent marks order delivered in Shopify
```

---

## External Event Monitoring

Your agents can watch the world and act on your fleet proactively.

### Weather Monitoring
```
MONITOR: Weather API (OpenWeather, Tomorrow.io)
DETECT:  Severe weather warning for fleet area
ACT:
  - Create temporary hazard zones in Geotab
  - Alert drivers in affected areas
  - Suggest alternate routes
  - Notify dispatch of potential delays
```

### Traffic & Road Closures
```
MONITOR: Traffic APIs (Google Maps, HERE, Waze)
DETECT:  Road closure or major accident on common routes
ACT:
  - Create avoidance zones in Geotab
  - Re-route affected vehicles
  - Update customer ETAs
  - Log disruption for reporting
```

### News & Events
```
MONITOR: News APIs, event calendars, city feeds
DETECT:  Major event (concert, sports game, parade)
ACT:
  - Create temporary zones around venue
  - Adjust delivery windows for area
  - Alert drivers about parking/traffic
  - Pre-position vehicles outside affected area
```

### Fuel Price Monitoring
```
MONITOR: Fuel price APIs (GasBuddy, OPIS)
DETECT:  Price drop at stations along routes
ACT:
  - Update recommended fuel stops
  - Alert drivers near cheap stations
  - Log savings opportunities
```

### Customer System Integration
```
MONITOR: Your CRM, order system, or scheduling tool
DETECT:  New order, appointment change, cancellation
ACT:
  - Assign/reassign vehicles in Geotab
  - Update driver assignments
  - Adjust routes and schedules
  - Confirm with customer
```

---

## Example: Proactive Weather Agent

**Vibe prompt for AI:**
```
Build a Python script that:
1. Checks weather API (Tomorrow.io) for severe weather in my fleet's area
2. When alerts found, creates temporary hazard zones in Geotab
3. Alerts drivers currently in affected areas
4. Runs on a 30-minute schedule

Use the geotab-api-quickstart skill for Geotab connection.
```

This pattern works for any external data source → Geotab action.

---

## Voice Agents

Voice interfaces add a natural interaction layer to fleet management. See [Advanced Integrations](./ADVANCED_INTEGRATIONS.md) for detailed voice implementation patterns.

### Voice Agent Types

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Query Agents** | Answer questions | "Where is truck 42?" → spoken response |
| **Command Agents** | Take actions via voice | "Mark delivery complete" → updates Geotab |
| **Proactive Agents** | Call/alert humans | System calls dispatcher about critical fault |
| **Phone Agents** | Handle inbound calls | Customer calls to check delivery ETA |

### Voice for Fleet Managers

Hands-free fleet queries while in the field:
```
"Hey Fleet, where are my drivers?"
"Which vehicles need maintenance this week?"
"Alert me if anyone speeds over 80"
```

### Voice for Drivers

Safe, hands-free interaction:
```
"What's my next stop?"
"Mark this delivery complete"
"Report a vehicle issue"
```

### Phone-Based Voice Agents

AI agents that make or receive actual phone calls:

**Outbound (Agent calls humans):**
```
Critical fault detected →
  Agent calls dispatcher: "Vehicle 2417 has a critical engine fault
  at mile marker 145 on I-35. Driver has been notified. Should I
  dispatch roadside assistance?"
```

**Inbound (Humans call agent):**
```
Customer calls delivery line →
  Agent answers: "Hi, I can help you track your delivery.
  What's your order number?"
  Customer: "12345"
  Agent: "Your delivery is 15 minutes away. The driver is
  John in a white van. Anything else I can help with?"
```

### Voice Agent Tools

| Tool | Type | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **Vapi** | Phone AI | Building phone agents quickly |
| **Bland.ai** | Phone AI | Enterprise phone automation |
| **Twilio + AI** | Phone infrastructure | Custom phone solutions |
| **Retell AI** | Phone AI | Conversational phone agents |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | Speech-to-text | Transcription |
| **ElevenLabs** | Text-to-speech | Natural-sounding voices |
| **Deepgram** | Speech-to-text | Real-time transcription |

### Example: Proactive Alert Call Agent

**Vibe prompt for AI:**
```
Build a voice agent using Vapi that:
1. Monitors Geotab for critical fault codes
2. When found, calls the dispatcher
3. Explains the situation (vehicle, fault, location, driver)
4. Can answer follow-up questions
5. Offers to dispatch roadside assistance
6. Logs the call outcome

Use geotab-api-quickstart skill for Geotab, Vapi docs for phone calls.
```

```

---

### Simple Python + Cron (For Minimalists)

Sometimes you don't need a framework. A Python script running on a schedule does the job.

**Example:**
```python
# run_every_5_minutes.py
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Fetch recent trips from Geotab
trips = geotab_api.get("Trip", search={"fromDate": datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=1)})

# Check for speeding
for trip in trips:
    if trip.get("speedingDuration", 0) > 60:  # More than 60 seconds
        send_slack_alert(f"Vehicle {trip['device']['name']} had speeding event")
```

**Run with cron:**
```bash
*/5 * * * * python /path/to/run_every_5_minutes.py
```

**Hosting options:**
- Cron on any Linux server
- GitHub Actions (free for public repos)
- AWS Lambda + EventBridge
- Google Cloud Run Jobs
- Replit (free tier with limitations)

---

## Getting Started

### Path 1: Visual/No-Code (Recommended for beginners)

1. **[n8n Quickstart Guide](./AGENTIC_QUICKSTART_N8N.md)** — Build your first monitoring workflow
2. Start with a simple use case (speeding → Slack)
3. Gradually add complexity (multiple conditions, more integrations)

### Path 2: Code-First with AI

1. Review [Google ADK Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/)
2. Start with the [Multi-Agent Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/production-ready-ai-with-gc/3-developing-agents/build-a-multi-agent-system-with-adk)
3. Build a simple agent that monitors one metric

### Path 3: Simple Scripts

1. Write a Python script that polls Geotab API
2. Add condition checking and alerting
3. Deploy to cron, GitHub Actions, or serverless

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Rate Limiting
Don't poll Geotab API every second. Use reasonable intervals (5-15 minutes for most use cases).

### Alert Fatigue
Too many alerts = ignored alerts. Set meaningful thresholds and consolidate notifications.

### Credential Security
Never hardcode API keys. Use environment variables or secrets management.

### Error Handling
Networks fail. APIs timeout. Build retry logic and graceful degradation.

### State Management
Track what you've already processed to avoid duplicate alerts.
