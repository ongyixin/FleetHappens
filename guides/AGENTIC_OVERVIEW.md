# Agentic Fleet Systems: Overview

**Autonomous agents that monitor your fleet and take action—without you lifting a finger.**

This guide explains what "agentic" means for fleet management, when you need it, and which tools to use.

---

## What is an "Agentic" System?

Traditional fleet tools require you to check dashboards, run reports, and take action manually. An **agentic system** flips this:

| Traditional Approach | Agentic Approach |
|---------------------|------------------|
| You check the dashboard | The system monitors continuously |
| You notice a problem | The system detects it automatically |
| You decide what to do | The system decides (rules or AI) |
| You take action | The system acts (alerts, tickets, API calls) |

### The Agentic Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   MONITOR → DETECT → DECIDE → ACT → (repeat forever)   │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Monitor**: Continuously watch Geotab data (vehicle locations, speeds, fault codes, trips)
2. **Detect**: Identify conditions that matter (speeding, geofence entry, engine fault, idle time)
3. **Decide**: Apply rules or AI reasoning to determine response
4. **Act**: Send alerts, create tickets, update systems, notify people

---

## Geotab Already Has Alerts—When Do You Need More?

**Important:** Geotab's built-in features handle many common scenarios:

| Built-In Feature | What It Does |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Rules & Exceptions** | Trigger on speeding, harsh braking, after-hours use, etc. |
| **Zones (Geofences)** | Detect entry/exit from defined areas |
| **Notifications** | Send email alerts when rules trigger |
| **Reports** | Scheduled email reports |

**Use Geotab native features when:**
- Email alerts are sufficient
- You need standard rule-based triggers (speed > X, zone entry, fault codes)
- You're okay with Geotab's built-in notification destinations

---

## When External Agentic Systems Add Value

Build an external agent when you need capabilities **beyond** Geotab's native features:

### 1. Different Alert Destinations
Geotab sends email. You need **Slack, Teams, Discord, SMS, PagerDuty**, or push notifications.

### 2. Integration with External Systems
- Create tickets in **ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk**
- Update records in **Salesforce, HubSpot, SAP**
- Log to **Google Sheets, Airtable, databases**
- Trigger webhooks in **custom applications**

### 3. Multi-Step Workflows
Not just "alert when X happens" but:
```
Fault code detected →
  Check vehicle location →
  Find nearest service center →
  Create maintenance ticket →
  Alert driver with directions →
  Notify fleet manager →
  Update CRM status
```

### 4. AI-Powered Decisions
Beyond threshold rules—using LLMs to:
- Analyze patterns and trends
- Generate personalized coaching recommendations
- Summarize incidents in natural language
- Make context-aware decisions

### 5. Cross-System Correlation
Combine Geotab data with external data:
- Weather conditions + driving behavior
- Traffic data + route optimization
- Customer delivery windows + ETA calculations

### 6. Custom Business Logic
Rules that don't fit Geotab's rule builder:
- "Alert only if this is the driver's 3rd speeding event this week"
- "Notify customer when delivery is 15 minutes away, but only during business hours"
- "Escalate to manager if no response within 30 minutes"

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Polling Loop (Simplest)

```
┌──────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Timer   │────▶│ Fetch Data │────▶│ Check    │
│ (5 min)  │     │ from Geotab│     │ Condition│
└──────────┘     └────────────┘     └────┬─────┘
                                         │
                              ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                              │ Condition met?      │
                              │ Yes → Send Alert    │
                              │ No  → Wait for next │
                              └─────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:** Simple, no infrastructure needed
**Cons:** Delay between event and detection (up to polling interval)

### Pattern 2: Webhook/Event-Driven

```
┌──────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ Geotab   │────▶│ Webhook    │────▶│ Process  │
│ Event    │     │ Endpoint   │     │ & Act    │
└──────────┘     └────────────┘     └──────────┘
```

**Pros:** Near real-time, efficient
**Cons:** Requires webhook support, always-on endpoint

### Pattern 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Monitor    │────▶│ Analyzer    │────▶│ Actor       │
│ Agent      │     │ Agent (AI)  │     │ Agent       │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
      │                   │                   │
      └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                    Coordinator
```

**Pros:** Complex reasoning, scalable
**Cons:** More infrastructure, higher cost

**[Start with the n8n Quickstart Guide →](./AGENTIC_QUICKSTART_N8N.md)**

---

### Google ADK (For AI-Powered Agents)

[Google Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) is a code-first framework for building AI agents.

**Why Google ADK:**
- Model-agnostic (works with Gemini, but also other LLMs)
- Multi-agent orchestration built-in
- Deploys to Cloud Run or Vertex AI
- Under 100 lines for basic agents
- Python, Go, and TypeScript support

**Example agent:**
```python
from google.adk import Agent, Tool

fleet_agent = Agent(
    name="safety_monitor",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    tools=[geotab_tool, slack_tool],
    instructions="""
    Monitor fleet safety events. When you detect
    harsh braking or speeding, alert the supervisor
    with context about the driver's recent behavior.
    """
)
```

**Resources:**
- [ADK Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)
- [ADK Python GitHub](https://github.com/google/adk-python)
- [Multi-Agent Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/production-ready-ai-with-gc/3-developing-agents/build-a-multi-agent-system-with-adk)

---

### LangGraph (For Complex Workflows)

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) models agent logic as a graph—nodes are steps, edges are transitions.

**Why LangGraph:**
- Precise control over branching and error handling
- Visual debugging of agent execution
- Lowest latency/token usage in benchmarks
- Strong community and documentation

**Example use case:**
```
Detect fault code →
  Is it critical?
    Yes → Check driver location → Route to nearest service → Alert driver
    No → Log for next maintenance review
```

---

### Simple Python + Cron (For Minimalists)

Sometimes you don't need a framework. A Python script running on a schedule does the job.

**Example:**
```python
# run_every_5_minutes.py
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Fetch recent trips from Geotab
trips = geotab_api.get("Trip", search={"fromDate": datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=1)})

# Check for speeding
for trip in trips:
    if trip.get("speedingDuration", 0) > 60:  # More than 60 seconds
        send_slack_alert(f"Vehicle {trip['device']['name']} had speeding event")
```

**Run with cron:**
```bash
*/5 * * * * python /path/to/run_every_5_minutes.py
```

**Hosting options:**
- Cron on any Linux server
- GitHub Actions (free for public repos)
- AWS Lambda + EventBridge
- Google Cloud Run Jobs
- Replit (free tier with limitations)

## Getting Started

### Path 1: Visual/No-Code (Recommended for beginners)

1. **[n8n Quickstart Guide](./AGENTIC_QUICKSTART_N8N.md)** — Build your first monitoring workflow
2. Start with a simple use case (speeding → Slack)
3. Gradually add complexity (multiple conditions, more integrations)

### Path 2: Code-First with AI

1. Review [Google ADK Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/)
2. Start with the [Multi-Agent Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/production-ready-ai-with-gc/3-developing-agents/build-a-multi-agent-system-with-adk)
3. Build a simple agent that monitors one metric

### Path 3: Simple Scripts

1. Write a Python script that polls Geotab API
2. Add condition checking and alerting
3. Deploy to cron, GitHub Actions, or serverless

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Rate Limiting
Don't poll Geotab API every second. Use reasonable intervals (5-15 minutes for most use cases).

### Alert Fatigue
Too many alerts = ignored alerts. Set meaningful thresholds and consolidate notifications.

### Credential Security
Never hardcode API keys. Use environment variables or secrets management.

### Error Handling
Networks fail. APIs timeout. Build retry logic and graceful degradation.

### State Management
Track what you've already processed to avoid duplicate alerts.
