# Beta Tester Guide

Welcome, beta tester! You're helping us refine this curriculum before the hackathon. Your feedback is invaluable.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get the Code

**Option A: Clone (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhoffa/geotab-vibe-guide.git
cd geotab-vibe-guide
```

**Option B: Fork First (if you want to submit PRs)**
1. Click "Fork" on https://github.com/fhoffa/geotab-vibe-guide
2. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geotab-vibe-guide.git
cd geotab-vibe-guide
```

**Option C: Download ZIP (no git required)**
1. Go to https://github.com/fhoffa/geotab-vibe-guide
2. Click "Code" > "Download ZIP"
3. Extract to a folder on your desktop

### Step 2: Get Geotab Demo Credentials

If you don't have a Geotab account yet:

1. Go to https://my.geotab.com/registration.html
2. Fill in your details (takes ~2 minutes)
3. You'll get instant access to a demo database with sample vehicles and data

Save your credentials - you'll need them for the tutorials.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
# GEOTAB_DATABASE=your_database
# GEOTAB_USERNAME=your_email
# GEOTAB_PASSWORD=your_password
# GEOTAB_SERVER=my.geotab.com
```

## Your Sandbox Folder

**Keep your experiments separate from the curriculum!**

Create a `sandbox/` folder for your own projects:

```
geotab-vibe-guide/
├── guides/           # Don't modify - curriculum content
├── examples/         # Don't modify - reference examples
├── skills/           # Don't modify - AI patterns
├── sandbox/          # YOUR SPACE - experiment here!
│   ├── my-first-addin/
│   ├── dashboard-experiments/
│   └── notes.md
└── ...
```

The `sandbox/` folder is gitignored, so your experiments won't interfere with git operations or accidentally get committed.

```bash
# Create your sandbox
mkdir sandbox
```

**Folder structure suggestion for your projects:**

```
sandbox/
├── addins/              # Your Add-In experiments
│   └── my-fleet-view/
├── python/              # Your Python scripts
│   └── trip-analyzer/
├── notes/               # Your learning notes
│   └── feedback.md
└── README.md            # Track what you're building
```

## What to Test

### Path A: No-Code Add-In (5 min)
**Test the Google Gem experience:**
1. Read `guides/GOOGLE_GEM_USER_GUIDE.md`
2. Try the Gem at https://gemini.google.com/gem/geotab-add-in-architect
3. Generate an Add-In and install it in MyGeotab

**Questions to consider:**
- Was the guide clear?
- Did the Gem produce working JSON?
- Any confusing steps?

### Path B: Claude Instant Start (15 min)
**Test AI-assisted coding:**
1. Read `guides/INSTANT_START_WITH_CLAUDE.md`
2. Open Claude (web, desktop, or Claude Code)
3. Share `VIBE_CODING_CONTEXT.md` with Claude
4. Follow the prompts to fetch your first data

**Questions to consider:**
- Did the prompts work as expected?
- Was the context file helpful?
- What would you add or change?

### Path C: Python Examples (30-60 min)
**Test the progressive curriculum:**
1. Start with `examples/python/01_authentication/TASK.md`
2. Use your preferred AI tool to complete the task
3. Move through 02, 03, etc.

**Questions to consider:**
- Is the difficulty progression right?
- Are the vibe prompts effective?
- Did you get stuck anywhere?

### Path D: Add-In Development (30 min)
**Test the Add-In workflow:**
1. Read `guides/GEOTAB_ADDINS.md`
2. Try the embedded Add-In examples
3. Optionally try `guides/TRANSFORM_ADDIN_ZENITH.md`

**Questions to consider:**
- Is the MyGeotab Add-In process clear?
- Did the examples work?
- Was the Zenith transformation guide useful?

### Path E: Agentic Systems (Optional)
**For advanced testers:**
1. Read `guides/AGENTIC_OVERVIEW.md`
2. Review `guides/AGENTIC_QUICKSTART_N8N.md`

## Loading Skills in Your AI Tool

### Claude Code (CLI)
The skills are automatically available when you run Claude Code from this repo:
```bash
cd geotab-vibe-guide
claude
```
Claude will read `CLAUDE.md` and have access to all skills.

### Claude Desktop/Web
Share the context file at the start of your conversation:
1. Copy contents of `VIBE_CODING_CONTEXT.md`
2. Paste into your first message
3. Or upload the file directly

### Cursor / Windsurf / Other IDEs
1. Open the `geotab-vibe-guide` folder as your project
2. The AI will have access to all files
3. Point it to `VIBE_CODING_CONTEXT.md` for quick context

### ChatGPT / Other Tools
1. Upload or paste `VIBE_CODING_CONTEXT.md`
2. Optionally upload specific guide files you're working with

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Double-check your `.env` file (no quotes around values)
- Verify credentials at my.geotab.com
- Wait 15-30 min if you got locked out from too many attempts

### "Module not found"
```bash
pip install python-dotenv requests mygeotab
```

### Add-In doesn't appear in MyGeotab
- Make sure you're in Admin mode
- Check that JSON is valid (use a JSON validator)
- Try refreshing the page

### Claude doesn't understand the Geotab API
- Share `VIBE_CODING_CONTEXT.md` at the start
- For deeper context, share the specific guide file too
- Try: "Read the GEOTAB_ADDINS.md guide and then help me..."
