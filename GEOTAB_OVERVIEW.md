## Choosing Your Focus

When building a Geotab application, consider focusing on one or more of these pillars:

- **Which pillar aligns with your interests?** Safety-focused? Sustainability-driven? Optimization enthusiast?
- **What problem can you solve?** Each pillar represents real challenges that fleet managers face daily
- **How can you add unique value?** Combine data in new ways, apply analytics, create better visualizations

A focused solution addressing one pillar can be incredibly impactful!

## Beyond Reading Data: Writing Back to Geotab

Most developers start by **reading data** from Geotab - fetching vehicle locations, trips, fuel transactions, etc. But Geotab's true power comes from being able to **write data back** to the platform, enabling automation and intelligent fleet management.

### What You Can Write to Geotab

The Geotab API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), allowing you to:

- **Create custom groups** to organize vehicles
- **Set up automated rules** to trigger actions based on conditions
- **Add custom devices** and integrate third-party hardware
- **Update user permissions** and access controls
- **Schedule maintenance** and service reminders
- **Create zones** (geographic boundaries) for geofencing
- **Add exceptions** for tracking specific events
- **Configure notifications** for critical alerts

This two-way communication transforms Geotab from a monitoring tool into an **intelligent automation platform**.

## Geotab Groups: Dynamic Fleet Organization

**Groups** in Geotab are organizational containers for vehicles, drivers, or assets. Instead of static assignments, you can create **dynamic, intelligent groups** based on data analysis.

### Examples of Data-Driven Groups

By analyzing fleet data, you can automatically create groups such as:

- **"High Fuel Efficiency Vehicles"**: Vehicles achieving above-average MPG
- **"Urban Route Specialists"**: Vehicles that primarily operate within city limits
- **"Long-Haul Fleet"**: Vehicles with trips averaging over 200 miles
- **"Safety Champions"**: Vehicles/drivers with exceptional safety scores
- **"Maintenance Due Soon"**: Vehicles approaching their service intervals
- **"Evening Shift Vehicles"**: Vehicles primarily used during night hours
- **"Frequent Idlers"**: Vehicles with high idle time (targets for driver coaching)
- **"Cold Weather Fleet"**: Vehicles operating in regions with freezing temperatures
- **"Underutilized Assets"**: Vehicles with low usage that could be reassigned
- **"Customer Site Regulars"**: Vehicles frequently visiting specific locations

### Why This Matters

Dynamic groups enable:
- **Targeted coaching**: Communicate with specific driver groups
- **Specialized maintenance**: Different service schedules for different usage patterns
- **Custom reporting**: Compare performance across meaningful segments
- **Intelligent dispatch**: Assign jobs to the most suitable vehicles
- **Behavior-based incentives**: Reward high-performing groups

## Geotab Rules: Automated Intelligence

**Rules** in Geotab are condition-action pairs that automate responses to fleet events. You can create sophisticated rules that trigger when specific conditions are met.

### Examples of Powerful Rules

Here are examples of rules you can set up programmatically:

#### Safety Rules
- **"Harsh Braking Alert"**: Notify manager when driver has 3+ harsh braking events in one day
- **"Speeding in School Zone"**: Immediate alert when vehicle exceeds speed limit near schools
- **"After-Hours Unauthorized Use"**: Alert when vehicle moves outside business hours
- **"Seatbelt Violation"**: Notify supervisor when vehicle moves without seatbelt engaged

#### Efficiency Rules
- **"Excessive Idling"**: Alert when vehicle idles for more than 10 minutes
- **"Route Deviation"**: Notify when vehicle strays from planned route by more than 5 miles
- **"Fuel Theft Detection"**: Alert on sudden fuel level drops while parked
- **"Off-Hours Utilization"**: Track vehicles available for after-hours emergency use

#### Maintenance Rules
- **"Engine Light Warning"**: Immediate notification when check engine light activates
- **"Preventive Maintenance Due"**: Alert at 90% of scheduled maintenance interval
- **"Low Battery Voltage"**: Early warning for battery issues before failure
- **"Tire Pressure Alert"**: Notify when tire pressure drops below threshold

#### Compliance Rules
- **"HOS Violation Approaching"**: Warn drivers 30 minutes before hours of service limit
- **"Missing DVIR"**: Alert when driver hasn't completed daily vehicle inspection
- **"Geofence Violation"**: Notify when vehicle exits authorized service area
- **"Emissions Threshold"**: Alert for vehicles exceeding emission standards

#### Custom Business Rules
- **"Delivery Confirmation"**: Auto-generate report when vehicle enters customer zone
- **"Customer Site Arrival"**: Send notification to customer when driver is 5 minutes away
- **"Equipment Temperature"**: Alert if refrigerated cargo exceeds safe temperature
- **"First-In Cleaning"**: Assign cleaning task to first vehicle returning to depot

### Building Rules Programmatically

Your application can analyze fleet data and automatically create rules. By using the Geotab API, you can programmatically create condition-action pairs that trigger when specific events occur - such as creating personalized safety alerts when a driver exceeds their custom speed threshold, or scheduling maintenance when diagnostic patterns indicate potential issues.

## The Demo Database: Your Live Sandbox

When you create a Geotab demo account, you get access to a **continuously streaming dataset** that simulates a real fleet. This is not static data - it's a live simulation with:

- **Real-time vehicle movements**: GPS breadcrumbs updating constantly
- **Realistic trip patterns**: Vehicles following believable routes
- **Diagnostic events**: Engine data, fault codes, maintenance triggers
- **Driver behaviors**: Speeding events, harsh braking, acceleration patterns
- **Fuel transactions**: Realistic fuel consumption and fill-up events
- **Continuous updates**: New data arriving 24/7, just like a real fleet

This means you can build and test applications that respond to live data, create rules that trigger in real-time, and see how your analytics perform with constantly changing conditions - exactly like you would with a production fleet.


## Building with Geotab

Ready to build? Here's a typical development path:

1. **Explore the data**: Use the API to understand what information is available
2. **Choose your focus**: Pick which pillar (Safety, Productivity, etc.) aligns with your goals
3. **Analyze patterns**: Look for insights in the data (which vehicles idle most? Which drivers are safest?)
4. **Create value**: Build groups, rules, dashboards, or applications that help fleet managers
5. **Automate actions**: Don't just display data - create automated workflows that improve operations

The best Geotab applications create **actionable intelligence** that makes fleet management more efficient and effective.
