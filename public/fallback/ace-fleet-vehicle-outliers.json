  "reasoning": "Patel (Truck 04) leads by total distance at 980 km — 16% above the next-highest vehicle, suggesting a longer daily route corridor. Nguyen (Van 05) has the most trips (34) with the lowest idle rate (8.7%), pointing to tight urban delivery loops with minimal wait time. Robinson (Truck 06) is the fleet's idle outlier at 27.4% — nearly 2× the fleet average of 14.2% — likely driven by extended loading dock waits at the Fremont Warehouse. Consider re-routing Robinson to a site with a dedicated unloading bay.",
