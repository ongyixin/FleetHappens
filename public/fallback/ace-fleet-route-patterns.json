  "reasoning": "The Oakland → SF Embarcadero corridor is the fleet's busiest lane at 89 runs in 14 days — averaging 6.4 trips per day. The Fremont → San Jose run at 31.7 km average is the longest routine corridor; consolidating loads here could reduce per-km cost by an estimated 18%. The Milpitas → Palo Alto route (28 trips) shows opportunity for scheduled batching — 85% of those runs leave within a 40-minute window each morning.",
