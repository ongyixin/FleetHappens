  "reasoning": "Friday shows the highest idle time at 24.1%, likely correlating with end-of-week delivery congestion and increased urban traffic. Weekend patterns show significantly lower idle times, suggesting lighter operational activity. Wednesday's mid-week spike (21.4%) may relate to scheduled service calls.",
