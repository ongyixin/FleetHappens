  "reasoning": "Oakland Distribution Center is the fleet's primary endpoint with 247 visits in 30 days — 31% more than the next-closest location. Fremont Warehouse stands out with the highest average dwell time at 72 minutes, suggesting a queuing or loading-bay constraint that is contributing to elevated idle times for that lane. Together the top 5 locations account for approximately 79% of all trip endpoints.",
