  "reasoning": "North Region leads the fleet at 8,420 km — 37% above South Region and nearly 2.6× East Region. North's 12 vehicles average 701 km/vehicle vs. West's 642 km/vehicle, but West's 5 vehicles run the highest utilisation rate at 80% active. East Region shows the most concerning metric: 17.5% average idle time vs. fleet avg of 13.2%, warranting a scheduling review for the Fremont–Hayward corridor.",
