    { "metric": "Avg trip duration (min)",    "value": 87 },

  "reasoning": "This month's fleet average trip duration is 87 minutes, with a median of 74 minutes — the right skew is driven by a handful of long-haul runs up to 312 minutes. The fleet completed 1,247 trips in total. The 13-minute gap between mean and median suggests optimisation potential by identifying and routing the outlier long-duration trips more efficiently.",
