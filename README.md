# Geotab Vibe Coding: Zero to Hero

**Build fleet management apps in minutes using AI.**

This repository is a "Vibe Coding" starter kit. You don't need to be an expert coder. You just need to know how to ask the right questions.

## Before You Start

1. **Get credentials:** [Create a free demo database](https://my.geotab.com/registration.html) (takes 2 minutes)
2. **New to coding?** Read the [**Beginner's Glossary**](./guides/BEGINNER_GLOSSARY.md) first

## Choose Your Path

### Path A: Build a MyGeotab Add-In (Easiest!)
**Want a custom page that lives INSIDE MyGeotab? This is the fastest way.**

[**START WITH THE GOOGLE GEM**](./guides/GOOGLE_GEM_USER_GUIDE.md) - Describe what you want → Get JSON → Paste into MyGeotab → Done.

No coding. No hosting. No technical setup. Just conversation.

---

### Path B: Explore the API with Claude
**Want to explore the Geotab API and learn how it works?**

[**INSTANT START WITH CLAUDE**](./guides/INSTANT_START_WITH_CLAUDE.md) - Zero to working code in 60 seconds. No installation needed.

Then use [**CLAUDE PROMPTS**](./guides/CLAUDE_PROMPTS.md) for ready-made prompts to build things.

---

### Path C: Build a Python Dashboard
**Want a standalone app with maps, charts, and data analysis?**

[**ANTIGRAVITY QUICKSTART**](./guides/ANTIGRAVITY_QUICKSTART.md) - Use Google's free IDE to build interactive Streamlit dashboards.

---

### Path D: Advanced Add-In Development
**Need external APIs, complex frameworks, or hosted solutions?**

[**GEOTAB ADD-INS GUIDE**](./guides/GEOTAB_ADDINS.md) - Full guide for hosted Add-Ins with React, external data sources, and more.

## 🧘 What is "Vibe Coding"?

Vibe coding is about **flow**. Instead of fighting with syntax and documentation:
1.  **Ask** the AI to connect and explore.
2.  **Vibe** with the data it finds.
3.  **Iterate** on ideas ("Make it a dashboard", "Add a map").

## 🔄 Pro Strategy: Rotate Between Free AI Tools

**Don't limit yourself to one AI assistant!** Each tool has free usage quotas. Here's the smart approach:

1. **Code with Claude** until you hit the daily limit
2. **Ask the AI: "Save my work to GitHub"** (done!)
3. **Switch to ChatGPT or Gemini** and keep coding
4. **Repeat** as needed—your GitHub repo syncs everything

**Why this works**: Your code lives in GitHub (not in any single AI tool). Every AI can read your repo and continue where the last one left off. Think of GitHub as your project's home base and AI tools as interchangeable helpers.

**You don't need to learn Git or GitHub!** Just tell each AI to save your work. They handle all the technical details.

**Available free tools**: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot (trial), Replit AI, Google Antigravity IDE, and more!
