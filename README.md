# Geotab Vibe Coding: Zero to Hero 🚀

**Build fleet management apps in minutes using AI.**

This repository is a "Vibe Coding" starter kit. You don't need to be an expert coder. You just need to know how to ask the right questions.

## 🏁 Start Here

**New to coding?** Check out the [**Beginner's Glossary**](./guides/BEGINNER_GLOSSARY.md) to understand terms like GitHub, Python, API, IDE, and "vibe coding" before diving in.

Recommended workflow:

### **Part 1: The Chatbot (Web)**
**[👉 CLAUDE QUICKSTART (VIBE PROMPTS)](./guides/CLAUDE_PROMPTS.md)**
Start here! Copy-paste these "magic spells" into Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini to build your first script in the browser. Perfect for rapid prototyping.

### **Part 2: The IDE (Interactive App)**
**[⚡️ ANTIGRAVITY QUICKSTART (STREAMLIT)](./guides/ANTIGRAVITY_QUICKSTART.md)**
Ready to get serious? Use **Google Antigravity IDE** to build a full interactive dashboard with maps and charts, running locally on your machine.

### 2. **Authentication**
You will need a Geotab account. **[Create a free demo database here](https://my.geotab.com/registration.html)**.

*   **Database**: `database_name` (e.g., `geotab_demo`)
*   **Username**: `your_email@example.com`
*   **Password**: (Use a `.env` file or disposable demo credentials)

## 🧘 What is "Vibe Coding"?

Vibe coding is about **flow**. Instead of fighting with syntax and documentation:
1.  **Ask** the AI to connect and explore.
2.  **Vibe** with the data it finds.
3.  **Iterate** on ideas ("Make it a dashboard", "Add a map").

## 🔄 Pro Strategy: Rotate Between Free AI Tools

**Don't limit yourself to one AI assistant!** Each tool has free usage quotas. Here's the smart approach:

1. **Code with Claude** until you hit the daily limit
2. **Ask the AI: "Save my work to GitHub"** (done!)
3. **Switch to ChatGPT or Gemini** and keep coding
4. **Repeat** as needed—your GitHub repo syncs everything

**Why this works**: Your code lives in GitHub (not in any single AI tool). Every AI can read your repo and continue where the last one left off. Think of GitHub as your project's home base and AI tools as interchangeable helpers.

**You don't need to learn Git or GitHub!** Just tell each AI to save your work. They handle all the technical details.

**Available free tools**: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot (trial), Replit AI, Google Antigravity IDE, and more!
