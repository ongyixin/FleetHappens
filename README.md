**Build fleet management apps in minutes using AI.**

This repository is a "Vibe Coding" starter kit. You don't need to be an expert coder. You just need to know how to ask the right questions.

## Before You Start

1. **Get credentials:** [Create a free demo database](https://my.geotab.com/registration.html) (takes 2 minutes)
   > **Important:** On the registration page, click **"Create a Demo Database"** (not "I'm a New Customer"). This gives you pre-populated sample data to work with.
2. **New to coding?** Read the [**Beginner's Guide**](./guides/BEGINNER_GUIDE.md) first

## Choose Your Path

### Path A: Build a MyGeotab Add-In (Easiest!)
**Want a custom page that lives INSIDE MyGeotab? This is the fastest way.**

[**START WITH THE GOOGLE GEM**](./guides/GOOGLE_GEM_USER_GUIDE.md) - Describe (or draw) what you want → Get JSON → Paste into MyGeotab → Done.

No coding. No hosting. No technical setup. Just conversation.

---

### Path B: Explore the API with Claude
**Want to explore the Geotab API and learn how it works?**

[**INSTANT START WITH CLAUDE**](./guides/INSTANT_START_WITH_CLAUDE.md) - Zero to working code in 60 seconds. No installation needed.

Then use [**CLAUDE PROMPTS**](./guides/CLAUDE_PROMPTS.md) for ready-made prompts to build things.

---

### Path C: Build a Dashboard App
**Want a standalone app with maps, charts, and data analysis?**

[**ANTIGRAVITY QUICKSTART**](./guides/ANTIGRAVITY_QUICKSTART.md) - Use Google's free IDE to build interactive dashboards.

[**GOOGLE TOOLS GUIDE**](./guides/GOOGLE_TOOLS_GUIDE.md) - Overview of all Google vibe coding tools: Gemini Canvas, AI Studio, Firebase Studio, Gemini CLI, and Project Astra.

---

### Path D: Advanced Add-In Development
**Need external APIs, complex frameworks, or hosted solutions?**

[**GEOTAB ADD-INS GUIDE**](./guides/GEOTAB_ADDINS.md) - Full guide for hosted Add-Ins with React, external data sources, and more.

---

### Path E: Fleet Analytics with Data Connector
**Want pre-built KPIs, safety scores, and fault data without writing API calls?**

[**DATA CONNECTOR GUIDE**](./guides/DATA_CONNECTOR.md) - Query aggregated fleet metrics through the Data Connector endpoint. Works with Python, Excel, Power BI, or any HTTP client.

---

### Path F: Automated Monitoring & Alerts (Agentic Systems)
**Want autonomous agents that monitor your fleet 24/7 and take action?**

[**AGENTIC OVERVIEW**](./guides/AGENTIC_OVERVIEW.md) - Understand what agentic systems are and choose your approach.

[**N8N QUICKSTART**](./guides/AGENTIC_QUICKSTART_N8N.md) - Build your first fleet monitoring agent in 30 minutes using n8n's visual workflow builder.

Examples: Speeding alerts to Slack, maintenance ticket creation, geofence notifications, AI-powered safety coaching.

## 🧘 What is "Vibe Coding"?

Vibe coding is about **flow**. Instead of fighting with syntax and documentation:
1.  **Ask** the AI to connect and explore.
2.  **Vibe** with the data it finds.
3.  **Iterate** on ideas ("Make it a dashboard", "Add a map").

**Ready? [Start with the Google Gem](./guides/GOOGLE_GEM_USER_GUIDE.md) and build your first Add-In by describing (or drawing) what you want!**
